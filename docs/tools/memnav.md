## Knowledge Mining

Most of us routinely use search engines to navigate the internet.

## Machine-Readable Thought

However, in order to create tools capable of navigating our memories, we first need to convert them into a machine-readable format.

## Design

Now that the memories are in a machine-readable format, we can start navigating them through conventional knowledge mining techniques.

### Semantic Search

Internet search engines aren't constrained to the *exact* words in your query.

### Question Answering

When navigating the internet, you might often want a quick answer to a question, rather than a full-blown article on the subject.

### Summarization

Maybe you're not looking for an explicit detail, but you're trying to get the general gist of a subject.

## Samples

## Paradigms

It might be useful to go beyond the technicalities and reflect on the very identity of this project. By taking various perspectives on it, we can get a better sense of the interplay between tools for thought and existing technical frameworks.

### Search Engines

This is the view behind the opening paragraph. MemNav can intuitively be likened to a search engine.

### Expert Systems

Expert systems had been a success story of early AI research. Take the expertise of a doctor, embed it into propositional statements and inference rules, and you get a system which can give diagnostics with decent accuracy. Do the same with the expertise of a judge, and you get a system capable of giving rudimentary verdicts in court. 

### Exosomatic Memory

When your computer runs low on storage, you might move a few files to an external drive or to the cloud. 

### The Mind's API

When a piece of software exposes an API, it offers an interface to third-party software as a means of programmatically interacting with it.
