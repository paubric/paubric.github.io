## Empowering The Creator

Not all educational resources are created equal.

One approach to improving the quality of educational resources has been to empower creators with tools to produce ever more brain-friendly content.

## Empowering The Audience

However, few creators possess the skill, interest, and know-how required to create such cognitively ergonomic content.

What if we could automatically turn the mountains of resources available in unfriendly formats into something more memorable, humane, and ergonomic?

## Design

## Samples

To get a sense of the pipeline's performance, several samples from various disciplines are listed below. Each excerpt is followed by a set of automatically generated flashcards.

### Physics

{: .quote .mt-4 }
Kirchhoff’s junction rule says that the total current into a junction equals the total current out of the junction. This is a statement of conservation of charge. It is also sometimes called Kirchhoff’s first law, Kirchhoff’s current law, the junction rule, or the node rule. Junctions can’t store current, and current can’t just disappear into thin air because charge is conserved. Therefore, the total amount of current flowing through the circuit must be constant.

| Question | Answer |
|-|-|
| What does Kirchhoff's junction rule say? | the total current into a junction equals the total current out of the junction |
| What is Kirchhoff's junction rule a statement of? | conservation of charge |
| What is another name for Kirchhoff's current law? | the junction rule |
| Why can't current disappear into thin air? | charge is conserved |
| The total amount of current flowing through a circuit must be what? | constant |

### History

{: .quote .mt-4 }
King Philip’s ultimate goal was to conquer Persia and help himself to the empire’s land and riches. This was not to be; King Philip was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias in 336 B.C. at his daughter’s wedding, before he could enjoy the spoils of his victories. His son Alexander, known to history as "Alexander The Great," jumped at the chance to take over his father’s imperial project. The new Macedonian king led his troops across the Hellespont into Asia. (When he got there, he plunged an enormous sarissa into the ground and declared the land “spear won.”) From there, Alexander and his armies kept moving.

| Question | Answer |
|-|-|
| What was King Philip's ultimate goal? | conquer Persia |
| Who was King Philip's bodyguard? | Pausanias |
| Where was King Philip assassinated? | his daughter’s wedding |
| Who was King Philip's son? | Alexander |
| Alexander led his troops across the Hellespont into what continent? | Asia |
| What did Alexander plunge into the ground when he got to Asia? | sarissa |

### Biology

{: .quote .mt-4 }
DNA sequencing is a collection of scientific methods for determining the sequence of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA. All living organisms have DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in each of their cells. Each cell in an organism contains the genetic code for the entire organism. The process of DNA sequencing transforms the DNA from a given organism into a format that can be used by researchers for the basic study of biologic processes, medical research, and in forensics.

| Question | Answer |
|-|-|
| What is a collection of scientific methods for determining the sequence of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA? | DNA sequencing |
| What does DNA stand for? | deoxyribonucleic acid |
| What does each cell in an organism contain the genetic code for? | the entire organism |
| What is the use of DNA sequencing? | basic study of biologic processes, medical research, and in forensics |

### Architecture

{: .quote .mt-4 }
The Villa Savoye at Poissy, designed by Le Corbusier in 1929, represents the culmination of a decade during which the architect worked to articulate the essence of modern architecture. Throughout the 1920s, via his writings and designs, Le Corbusier (formerly Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) considered the nature of modern life and architecture’s role in the new machine age. His famous dictum, that “The house should be a machine for living in,” is perfectly realized within the forms, layout, materials, and siting of the Villa Savoye.

| Question | Answer |
|-|-|
| In what year was the Villa Savoye at Poissy designed? | 1929 |
| What was Le Corbusier's previous name? | Charles-Edouard Jeanneret |
| What was Le Corbusier's famous dictum? | The house should be a machine for living in |

### AI

{: .quote .mt-4 }
Generative adversarial networks consist of two networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other. The generator is trained to produce fake data, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish the generator’s fake data from real examples. If the generator produces fake data that the discriminator can easily recognize as implausible, such as an image that is clearly not a face, the generator is penalized. Over time, the generator learns to generate more plausible examples.

| Question | Answer |
|-|-|
| Who is trained to distinguish the generator's fake data from real examples? | the discriminator |
| What is the generator trained to produce? | fake data |
| What is an example of a implausible data that a discriminator can easily recognize? | an image that is clearly not a face |
| What does the generator learn to generate over time? | more plausible examples |

## Workflows

Individual samples are exciting, but it might be equally valuable to think through ways of integrating this experimental system into real workflows. A series of vignettes are provided below, each capturing the concrete routine of a hypothetical learner. This specific way of portraying otherwise exotic tools for thought was inspired by a seminal report on human augmentation.
